# Research Background

# Research background
1. How do __childhood experiences__ affect __adult convictions__ histories?
2. Adult convictions patterns are __heterogeneous__, and so we often summaries them as a set of __discrete trajectories__ with different shapes
3. Key insight one: childhood experiences affect adult convictions __cumulatively__. Our focus is on 'Crossover children' [(Baidawi, 2020:280)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0312407X.2019.1686765) who are involved with both youth justice __and__ child projection, and are expect to have an __extra__ disbenefit in criminal careers from being in contact with both systems
4. Key insight two: the ways in which childhood experiences shape adult outcomes may __vary by both sex and race/ethnicity__ [(Broidy et al. 2015:145)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40865-015-0008-z)

# Latent Class Growth Curves
- Latent Class Growth curves Models* (LCGM, [Nagin and Land 1993](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1993.tb01133.x) __make groups out of data__ based on a repeated measures dependent variable
- The data are split up into distinct __groups__ which each have their __own trajectories__ (in our case, probability of conviction in a given year)
- LCGMs are very popular (if divisive) in criminology [(Sampson and Laub 2005)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sampson/files/2005_crim_laub.pdf)
- Can give you a __categorical output__ (i.e. trajectory membership) for each person in the data that you can then analyse as outcome in a regression model
- You also get the probability that they belong to each trajectory

# Research questions
- How do the __cumulative__ effects of youth justice and child welfare contact on adult convictions trajectories __vary by sex and race/ethnicity__?
- Is there are a specific __additional association__ with adult convictions trajectory of having contact with youth justice __and__ child welfare?

# Methods: Quantiative intersectionality


---

# What is intersectionality?
- The idea has a complex history [(McCall 2005)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/426800?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), but as a term was popularized by [Kimberlé Crenshaw (1989)](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1052&amp;context=uclf)
- The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) definition is: "a theoretical framework for understanding how __aspects of a person's social and political identities... combine__ to create different modes of discrimination and privilege. Intersectionality identifies advantages and disadvantages that are felt by people due to a combination of factors."


---

# What is intersectionality?
- Analytically, "intersectionality" covers researchers in different theoretical traditions and with different research methods
- [Lesley McCall (2005)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/426800?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) talks about __three broad kinds__ of intersectional "complexity":
  - Anticategorical - __deconstructs__ analytical categories
  - Intracategorical - focuses on particular social groups at __neglected points of intersection__ to reveal the complexity of lived experience
  - Intercategorical - provisionally adopt existing analytical categories to __document relationships of inequality__ among social groups and changing configurations of inequality
- Each of these archetypal approaches has its own typical set of methods. __Quantitative__ studies of intersectionality are typically doing __intercategorical__ research




---
# Quantiative intersectionality
- (NB this is only a partial introduction - my route in was through epidemiology, though McCall herself is a sociologist and political scientist. Sorry if I miss anything important!)
- So far as I can tell, quantitative intersectionality __two main methodological components__:
  1. Fits (often quite complicated) models with __interactions__ between the effects of different independent variables (so, social characteristics) and the outcome
  2. Wants to avoid essentializing social groups by accounting for __variation__ in outcomes rather than just average outcomes __for people with the same observable characteristics__
- Juan Merlo calls this combination ["Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy" (MAIHDA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617307566?via%3Dihub)

# Part One: Intersectionality and interactions

---

# Problems with interactions
- In the MAIHDA approach we want to fit interactions between __all__ our independent variables
- Why do we need a fancy multilevel model for this?
- Lots of interactions means lots of significance tests, and so problems with __multiple testing__ - we'd [get some statistically significant results by chance](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-30571-005.html)
- Also, adding too many interaction effects in a standard regression model creates problems because of the __'curse of dimensionality'__
- Every extra (categorical) variable in the interaction __splits the sample up further and further__, making estimates unreliable as interactions for many combinations of variables are based on increasingly small amounts of data

# Interactions, bias and variance
- So how to resolve this?
- Conceptually, we want the model to find interactions __if there's enough data to support them__, but if there isn't enough data for a given combination of variables we want the model to be __sceptical__ about estimating a huge interaction effects and move its estimate towards zero
- In the stats lingo, we're trading off [bias for variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)
- We want to make our model actually fit the data in our dataset __worse__ (i.e. add bias) by making it __less sensitive to extreme values__ of these interaction effects when there isn't a lot of data to support them

---
# Scepticism through shrinkage
- __Multilevel models__ are one way to let us be a bit __sceptical__ of extremely large effects for parameters when there isn't a lot of data
- They do this by __'pooling' information__/'borrowing strength'/'shrinking' estimates across clusters
- Often these clusters are schools or hospitals or courts, in this case our clusters are combinations of independent variables (i.e. our interactions)
- This is because the multilevel model assumes that clusters are __drawn from a Normal distribution__, making it sceptical of extreme values
- Importantly for us, the model figures out how much information should be pooled __based on the data itself__: as [Michael Clark says](https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-05-14-shrinkage-in-mixed-models): "Data nuances will determine the relative amount of ‘strength borrowed’, but in general, [multilevel] models provide a good way for the __data to speak for itself when it should, and reflect an ‘average’ when there is little information__."
- See also the [Bell and colleagues paper (2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-30571-005.html) on this point

# What shrinkage looks like

.left-column[
From [Michael Clark's excellent blog post](https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-05-14-shrinkage-in-mixed-models) on shrinkage: estimates from individual clusters get 'shrunk' towards the global mean

# What shrinkage looks like
.left-column[
Here the data are __unbalanced__, so we have more people in some groups than others; estimates from the smaller groups get shrunk more towards the average effect.

# Other approaches
- You don't have to use a multilevel model though! There are also __other methods__ of doing this regularization: 
  - Penalized regression (see discussion between [Lizotte and colleagues (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953619304939) and [Evans et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953619304927#bib14))
  - ['Sceptical priors' in a Bayesian model](https://www.fharrell.com/post/journey/)
- The important thing I think is the __conceptual__ framing: we think the social world is complex so we want to fit a complicated statistical model, but we also want a mechanism to stop overfitting to small strata
- The multilevel model __balances__ these two concerns, [although it's not magic (Bell et al. 2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-30571-005.html)

# _Intermezzo_

  
---
# Fit these models with Bayes
- Okay we're really getting technical here but I __think__ there's also a difference here in how you'd understand what a multilevel model _is_ between Frequentist and Bayesian senses - the TLDR is that a Frequentist approach treats the 'levels' in a multilevel model as part of the model's error term (and so ["integrates them out of the likelihood"](https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/hierarchical-linear-models-bayes-vs-frequentist/12012/2)) - and the error term is by definition what you're __not__ modelling. 
- Whereas for Bayes these extra levels are (hyper-)parameters that you estimate directly
- The upshot is that I think you only get __uncertainty estimates__ for all your interaction terms in the multilevel specification with __Bayes__, and so this is the recommended approach
- I fit these models in `R` using  the `{brms}` package. There's a very involved __worked example__ of the approach I took [here](https://gist.github.com/benmatthewsed/a8136944dc31fcc26d2f2e433edaab6d). Others who have adopted this approach have used MLWiN which you can call through Stata

# Part Two: Variation in the outcome



---
# Variation in outcomes
- What about the describing variation in the outcome?
- We want to __avoid the ["Tyranny of the averages"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953617307566?via%3Dihub#sec5)__: assuming that everyone with the same characteristics has the same relationship between a 'risk factor' and the outcome we're interested in
- For __non-linear models__ we also have the general problem that any parameter estimate is "extraordinarily hard to interpret" in isolation because the effects of every variable are _already_ conditional on the values of other variables [(McElreath, 2016)](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019)

---
# Solution: prediction for inference
- Use Average Predictive Comparisons [(Gelman and Pardoe 2007)](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ape17.pdf) Specifically, in our case we used __Marginal Effects at Representative values__ (MERs)
- Decide what combinations of independent variables we're interested in (i.e., pick our representative values), use the model to __estimate outcomes for people with that combination of independent variables__ [(see also King et al. 2000)](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/making-abs.shtml)
- These predictions __incorporate the effects of all our interactions__ - that is, the levels of our 'multilevel' model - as well as the main effects of these variables
- For categorical models we get a __distribution of outcomes__ across the categories of our outcome - just what we want!
- We can still look at parameter estimates for interaction terms to see if specific interactions are important... but see the warning on the previous slide!

---
# Problem: interactions
- We still have another, sutble, problem in understanding cumulative effects though!
- Our MERs are __collapsible__: the amount your probability changes from a change in the presence of an independent variable depends on your probability in the absence of the independent variable
- So the using predictive MERs incorporates both the interactions from our intersectional random effect, but __also__ [__mathematical__, not subject-matter-relevant, interactions (Harrell, 2020)](https://www.fharrell.com/post/marg/) as a consequence of converting parameter estimates from the __log-odds to the probability scale__
- And so on the probability scale we could/will find __cumulative__ effects of having multiple childhood system contacts because of these __mathematical__ interactions, even if there is no __additional__ effect of having both youth justice and child welfare contact

---
# Problem: interactions


```r
library(tidyverse)

# say we have four independent variables which each
# increase the log-odds of the outcome by 1, but
# our two groups have very different baseline log-odds (i.e. intercepts)

vals &lt;- seq(-4, by = 1, length.out = 5)
vals2 &lt;-  seq(-1, by = 1, length.out = 5)

# turn the log-odds into probabilities

df &lt;- 
tibble(
  n_risk_factors = list(c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4")),
  logit_scale = list(vals, vals2),
  condition = list("low baseline", "high baseline")
  ) %&gt;% 
  unnest() %&gt;% 
  mutate(prob_scale = boot::inv.logit(logit_scale))
```

---
# (Possible) solutions: compare predictions across models
- To account for this cumulative effect of transforming our results into probabilities, we can __compare__ the estimated probabilities from our intersectional model to a model which __has all the fixed effects but doesn't have our intersectional random effect__
- This comparison gives us an estimate __additional__ difference in the effect of our intersectional random effect compared to a simpler model without the random effects

# A quick review

---
# In review
- We want to see how the __cumulative effects__ of contact with child welfare and youth justice on adult convictions trajectories __vary by sex and Indigenous status__
- And to see if there are particular extra effects of having contact with both child welfare and youth justice
- We want to fit a model with __lots of interactions__ and which helps us understand __variation in our outcome__ between people with the same observables
- We can do this by fitting our interactions as a level in a __multilevel model__ and by interpreting the model through __Marginal Effects at Representative values__ to get a distribution of outcomes for people with a given set of characteristics

2. Fit intersectional [(Bell et al. 2019)](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2019-30571-005.html) multinomial logistic regression model to __estimate associations__ between youth justice and child welfare __system contact and adult convictions class__
3. Interpret model results through __estimated probability of convictions class membership__, conditional different configurations of our independent variables

# Discussion
- Childhood experiences' relationships with the probability of adult convictions trajectories __do seem to differ by sex and Indigenous status__:
   - Non-Indigenous Status men and women have the largest decrease in probability of no/low class membership in presence of all childhood contacts
   - In contrast Indigenous Status men have the smallest decrease in probability of no/low trajectory membership in presence of all childhood contacts
- … but the __cumulative effect__ of these risk factors leads to __similar outcomes by sex`*`IS__, despite the very __different baselines__ by sex and IS

---
# Discussion
-	There was an __additional cross-over effect__ for Non-Indigenous Status women in the Low/Declining trajectory, but not much for other trajectories or groups
-	Possible explanations:
  - Non-Indigenous Status women in contact with both systems have (on average) worse circumstances for things we don’t measure? 
  - Particularly strong effect of labelling by both systems for Non-IS women? 
   - Mathematically, we see these bigger effects for Non-Indigenous Status women because their intercept in the model (when they have no contact with any system) is very, very low, in the part of the distribution where converting log-odds to probabilities has an outsized effect?
- We see a __lot of variation__ in estimated trajectories for people with the same observable characteristics. This reflects both things we haven’t included in the model, but also people’s differential responses to these childhood experiences

---
# Concluding thoughts

- This particular way of quantitatively modelling 'intersectionality' with multilevel models seems pretty good!
- I like that it's __exploratory__ - but you have to bear in mind that no 'significant' effect doesn't mean that no effect - it may just be that estimates were very aggressively shrunk towards zero ("Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence" and all that)
- If we had a more informed theoretical background perhaps we would have used a [more bespoke model](https://m-clark.github.io/posts/2019-05-14-shrinkage-in-mixed-models) to look for interactions and do this shrinkage?
- In the __multinomial__ case it's a bit of a pain though!

# Concluding thoughts
- What does IS measure here? Must __avoid deficit interpretation__ [(Walter and Andersen 2013)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781315426570)
- Same with sex/gender!
- Even though I've talked about it less today I think emphasising the variation in outcomes for people with the same observables has had a more profound impact on how I think about quantitative modelling (see also [this](http://nautil.us/issue/92/frontiers/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics))
- If you take anything from this talk please go and read [McCall (2005)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/426800?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)
